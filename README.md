# CCSpriteWithHue

`CCSpriteWithHue` is a subclass of `CCSprite` from [cocos2d](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone) that allows to programmatically adjust hue of the sprite.
 
The hue rotation technique allows you to get thousands of colorful variations of your original sprite. Supports animations and transparency.

The basics of the hue rotation algorithm were borrowed from Apple's [GLImageProcessing sample project](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/GLImageProcessing/Introduction/Intro.html)

## Demo

Build and run the __`CCSpriteWithHue-Sample`__ project in Xcode

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
CCSpriteWithHue* sprite = [CCSpriteWithHue spriteWithFile: @"mySprite.png"];
sprite.hue = M_PI_4;
```

The hue property represents the hue rotation angle from __0 to 2 * Ï€__ radians, but you can specify any value (it will remove full revolutions).
